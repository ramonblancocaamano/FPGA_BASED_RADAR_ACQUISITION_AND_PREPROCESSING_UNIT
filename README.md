# FPGA_BASED_RADAR_ACQUISITION_AND_PREPROCESSING_UNIT
In this dissertation, a study and a practical implementation of an acquisition and preprocessing unit are provided
for the digitization and suitability of the radar signals. The hardware solution allows the digitization of radar
signals at an appropriate speed and subsequently transfers the preprocessed data into a suitable interface. The
system must include a memory and a direct connection interface for storage and external communication with a
computer, respectively. The nal results are obtained by processing the sampled data. This task is performed by a
computer with a specic processing software designed by the department. The designed solution must be restrictive
in terms of size, weight and portability. A low power hardware is needed in order to feed the unit through external
batteries, keeping a suitable performance. From a commercial point of view, a cost eective and high integrated
solution is needed.
